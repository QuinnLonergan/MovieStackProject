# MovieStack

## Introduction

MovieStack is a social media application that allows users to swipe through a stack of movies via a Tinder-like UI, voting yes or no on each, then inviting friends to do the same and returning a movie that both users liked. There is also functionality to enable users to create and edit their own custom stacks of movies. With the oversaturation of options across streaming services, deciding on a movie can often been an arduous and tiring process. MovieStack streamlines the movie selection process by reducing the choice to a simple yes or no decision, then returns an album that both parties will (hopefully) be happy with.
